It provides:\n- TestRunner: wraps UI for headless testing with configurable dimensions\n- Snapshot: captures text, styles, and UI state (mode, cursor, file, etc.)\n- serialize/deserialize: for storing and comparing snapshots\n- sendKey/sendChar: for simulating user input\n- compare: diffs two snapshots and reports differences\n\nRemaining work is to add comprehensive tests using the harness (see child tasks).","priority":1,"completed":true,"result":"Testing harness fully implemented with comprehensive test suite:\n\n✓ Test infrastructure (test_harness.zig):\n  - TestRunner: headless UI testing with configurable dimensions\n  - Snapshot: captures UI state (text, styles, cursor, file, mode, etc.)\n  - Serialization/deserialization for snapshot comparison\n  - Key simulation (sendKey, sendChar, directional keys)\n  - Surface diff comparison\n\n✓ 59 existing unit tests covering:\n  - Cursor movement (up/down/home/end/page movements)\n  - Selection system (shift+arrows, selection persistence)\n  - Mode transitions (normal, comment, file_list, help, etc.)\n  - Comment submission (single/multiline, empty comments)\n  - View mode toggling (split/unified)\n  - File list navigation\n  - Rendering snapshots\n  - Edge cases (empty files, many files, wrapping)\n\n✓ 8 comprehensive integration tests for user workflows:\n  1.
