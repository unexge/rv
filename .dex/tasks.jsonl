When reviewing unstaged changes, users should be able to mark selected lines as \"approved\" and stage them using a new 'Stage' action (similar to 'Comment' and 'Ask').\n\n## Requirements\n1. New 'Stage' action triggered by 's' key on selected lines\n2. Only available when reviewing unstaged changes (not staged or commit mode)\n3. Uses `git add -p` or direct git index manipulation to stage hunks\n4. Visual feedback showing which lines have been staged\n5. Staged lines should be excluded from further review or shown differently\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Data Model (review.zig)\n- Add `StagedRange` struct to track staged line ranges per file\n- Add `staged_ranges: std.ArrayList(StagedRange)` to ReviewSession\n- Add `addStagedRange()` and `isStagedLine()` helper methods\n\n### Phase 2: Git Integration (git.zig)\n- Add `stageLines(path: []const u8, start_line: u32, end_line: u32)` function\n- Use `git add -p` with scripted input, or use `git update-index` with patch application\n- Handle edge cases: partial hunks, already staged content\n\n### Phase 3: UI Mode & Keybinding (ui.zig)\n- Add `.stage` variant to Mode enum (or implement as immediate action like selection toggle)\n- Add 's' keybinding in handleNormalKey when selection is active\n- Call `submitStage()` to execute staging\n- Show confirmation status message\n\n### Phase 4: Visual Feedback (ui.zig)\n- Modify renderDiffLine to show staged lines with distinct styling (e.g., green background or checkmark indicator)\n- Update status bar to show staged line count\n- Consider dimming or hiding staged lines to focus on remaining changes\n\n### Phase 5: Mode Guard\n- Detect if in staged/commit review mode and disable the stage action\n- Show helpful message if user tries to stage in wrong mode\n\n## Technical Considerations\n- Git staging granularity: git works with hunks, not arbitrary line ranges. May need to:\n  - Generate a patch for the selected lines and apply it\n  - Use `git add --patch` with expect-like scripting\n  - Or use libgit2/Zig git bindings for direct index manipulation\n- Refresh diff after staging: the staged lines will move from unstaged to staged diff\n- Consider undo capability for accidental staging\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] User can select lines and press 's' to stage them\n- [ ] Staged lines are visually distinguished\n- [ ] Running `git status` shows the changes as staged\n- [ ] Stage action is disabled in staged/commit review modes\n- [ ] Partial line ranges within a hunk can be staged", "priority": 1, "completed": true, "result": "Stage changes feature fully implemented:\n\n## Completed Subtasks:\n1. **StagedRange data model** - Data structures to track staged lines\n2. **Git staging for line ranges** - buildPartialPatch() extracts and applies hunks\n3. **Stage keybinding** - 'S' key stages selected lines with mode guard\n4. **Visual feedback** - Checkmark + muted colors for staged lines (both views)\n5. **Deferred diff refresh** - Refresh when navigating away, not immediately\n\n## Key Features:\n- Select lines and press 'S' to stage them to git index\n- Staged lines shown with green \u2713 checkmark and muted colors\n- Status bar shows \"Staged: X lines\" count\n- Diff refreshes when navigating to another file\n- Only available in unstaged mode (not staged/commit review)\n- Works in both unified and split view\n\nAll acceptance criteria met.

In submitStage(), after successful git.stageLineRange():\n2. Call git.runGitDiffWithDifft() for the current file only\n3. Re-parse the diff JSON with difft.parseDiffJson()\n4.
